Hello, It's me!
I've thought about us for a long long time
Maybe I think too much but something's wrong

There's something here, doesn't last too long
Maybe I shouldn't think of you as mine

Seeing you or seeing anything as much I do you
I take for granted that you're always there
I take for granted that you just don't care
Sometimes I can't help seeing all the way through
